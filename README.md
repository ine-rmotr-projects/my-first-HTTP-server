### [HTTP Using Python](https://my.ine.com/course/http-using-python/5279105b-904b-496c-bb42-8805ddb52462)

# My first HTTP server

In this exercise, you will need to construct a function that communicates with a locally running server.

In particular, you will connect to port 2551 on `localhost`, and to the resource path `/json`.  As the name suggests, this path will return JSON responses; however, your function should return a Python dictionary derived from that.

Start with the Notebook `Project.ipynb`, and best of luck!
